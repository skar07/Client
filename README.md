# Encora / Client

Encora prides itself in providing over A11Y and i18N react native components, that work both natively and on the web. Moreover, it comes bundled with Remix Icons consisting of over 2000 icons.

The style guides for the UI is largely influenced by Foretag's Sirocco design.

## Theming

We understand that each application has a unique requirement in how the UX, Branding and Structure is laid out, so Encora comes with a theme manager, which allows you easily manipulate all the components, their apperance and behaviour with ease.

## GraphQL 

![Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/blob/master/docs/source/logo/large.png?raw=true)

Encora uses Apollo Client a battle tested library, underneath the hood and all of the API is exposed for you to use. Out of the box, Encora provides additional optimizations on caching and querying; these can be overriden at the developers will.
